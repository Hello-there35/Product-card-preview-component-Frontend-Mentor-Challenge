## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I now feel that I understand responsive web design more. As well as how I should implement it in my designs. I also learnt to add more comments to make my code more understandable for everyone.


```css
 .card-container{
    width: 600px;
    height: 450px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 12px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content:space-between

   }
```
I learnt another way of using display flex property



### Continued development

I believe I need to start separating my css into different files as it will be easier for those going through my project.So that they understand where which content is and I will also start using comments a lot more often as this helps those understand the code a whole lot easier to read.



### Useful resources
